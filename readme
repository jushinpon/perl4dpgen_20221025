modify .bashrc to export conda path
put initial sout for the first training process
for all XX.sh files, you need to check the paths of all executables and slurm partitions

usage:
use the following command in scripts folder
perl main.pl > ../dpgen08.log &
the output file dpgen08.log means the eighth times for dpgen processes (all_npy01..all_npy07 you will have
)

#!!!!!!!!! VERY IMPORTANT. If you don't have proper settings for jobtype and begIter , all npy files could be gone. 
##########################################################################################
###before you conduct these scripts, you need to set proper settings in all_settings.pm especially for the fowllowing two:
$system_setting{jobtype} = "XX";
$system_setting{begIter} = "XX";

for jobtype hash, the following three can be used: 
1. new: a brand new job, you need to remove all "old all_npy folders"
2. dpgen_again: do dpgen using npy files from previous dpgen process you have done
3. rerun: for a broken job (like a blackout),you need to check if a iter (the last one when your job was terminated) has completed. if not, set the iter No ("$begIter" in main.pl) to be this one and remove this folder. If yes, you need to set $begIter to be the next iter no. 

for begIter hash, the following two should be considered: 
1. 0: a brand new job or dpgen_again
2. for rerun,you need to check if a iter (the last one when your job was terminated) has completed. if not, set the iter No ($system_setting{begIter}) to be this one and remove this folder. If yes, you need to set $begIter to be the next iter no. 

when you set dpgen_again, rename your all_npy folder to be all_npyXX (XX are 01, 02,... You can redo dpgen as many times as you need) for using npy files you have got by previous dpgen jobs

the following is under construction!!!

folders:
1. initial: put data (optimized cell) for lammps,type.raw,sout file (DFT output), masses.dat (each row for one element, for lmp) and exp and dft binding energy file
elements.dat (for DFT input, converting type.raw to element name). Format example, Al Cu Mo ... in a row
to establish a folder name the same as in the dpgen.json
2. dp_ 
3. you may modify slurm_dp.sh in the scripts folder for your machines (partition...), but you need to set anaconda base env first.
inform the administrator to put anaconda path in /etc/bashrc for all users.


 main.pl:
 my $initial_trainOnly = "yes";#if "yes", only conduct the initial training
